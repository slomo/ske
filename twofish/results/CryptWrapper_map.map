    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     33
      Number with same-slice register load:      5
      Number with same-slice carry load:        28
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,071 out of   6,822   15%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                    2,740 out of  13,644   20%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,251
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,944 out of   3,251   90%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
